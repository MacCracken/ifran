### Phase 4: API Server ✓
- [x] `synapse-api/rest/router`: Axum router setup with all route groups + CORS + telemetry

- [x] `synapse-api/rest/openai_compat`: `POST /v1/chat/completions` + `GET /v1/models` (OpenAI-compatible)
- [x] `synapse-api/rest/system`: `GET /health`, `GET /system/status`
- [x] `synapse-api/middleware/telemetry`: request tracing with `tower-http`

**MVP milestone: a user can `synapse pull`, `synapse run`, and hit a local OpenAI-compatible API.** ✓

## Post-v1 Considerations
- Model marketplace / shared registry between Synapse instances
- Distributed training across multiple Synapse nodes (via SY orchestration)
- Model evaluation benchmarks (automated quality scoring)
- Prompt management and versioning
- RAG pipeline integration
- WebAssembly builds for browser-based inference
- RLHF annotation UI in desktop app
- Multi-tenant support for shared deployments
